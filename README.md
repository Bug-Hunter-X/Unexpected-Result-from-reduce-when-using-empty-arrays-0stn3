This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Swift reduce function with an empty array and an initial value. The code in `bug.swift` showcases the problem, resulting in unexpected behavior. The solution in `bugSolution.swift` addresses this by adding a check for an empty array before using reduce, preventing potential crashes or unexpected results.  The solution handles empty arrays gracefully, ensuring correctness in all scenarios.
